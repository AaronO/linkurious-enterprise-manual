# Graph
Mathematical object used to model the relationships between objects. To analyse networks, we use graph theory. Google, Facebook or Linkedin are among the companies that use graphs.

# Edge
The relationships between the nodes of a graphes are called “edges” or “connections” or “links”.
Synonyms : link or connection or relationship

# Node
The different objects represented in a graph are called “nodes”.

# Property
A property is a value associated to a node or an edge. For example, if our graph contains a John Smith, we may have a node with the property ```name``` and the value ```John Smith```.

# Label
A label is a value associated to a node or an edge. It is a concept used to group nodes or edges into sets. For example if our graph contains many people like John Smith or Paul Durand, we may want to give these nodes a ```Person``` label.
