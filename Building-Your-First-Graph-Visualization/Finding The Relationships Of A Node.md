# Display The Relationships Of A Node

Time to find out about the particular relationships of a node. The easiest way to get that information is to double-click on the node you are interested in. Here we are interested in [Instagram](http://instagram.com/).

Now you can see all the nodes that are connected to Instagram.

Notice the white halo around each node? All the node surrounded by the white halo are connected to the currently selected node (or nodes). In this case, all the nodes are connected to Instagram.

The edges between the nodes represent the relationships. The relationships all have a direction from one node (the node where the base of the edge is large) to another (the pointy end of the arrow).

If I click on a given relationship, the properties of that relationship will be displayed in the left panel.
