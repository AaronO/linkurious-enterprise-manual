## Inspect nodes

In order to view the different properties of a node, we simply click on it. We immediately see information appear on the left side of the screen.



Here we can see that there is a node with the id ```#3886```. It is called ```Instagram``` and has a ```Company``` label. Below we can see the various properties associated with the node.

For example the node has a ```country``` property with the value ```USA```.

We can scroll down to see more properties or use the search bar to find a property.

Notice the number next to the node, it is the number of undisplayed relationships.

If we want to remove the left panel, we simply click on ```PROPERTIES``` (green circle).

Inspect edges in the same manner.
