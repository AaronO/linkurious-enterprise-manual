## Customize the captions

Linkurious Enterprise lets you choose which of the properties of your graph should be used displayed on the canvas.

In order to customize this, we need to open the design panel on the right.

Right now Linkurious Enterprise displays the ```name``` of the nodes. Now let's go to the ```Captions``` tab. Here we can see the different properties of the nodes in our graph. The ```name``` property is first. In the bottom of the screen, it is possible to select the relationships.

We want to show the ```city``` in the visualization. To do it, we simply drag ```city``` on the top of the list.

Now the text displayed next to your node changes. Instead of looking at ```Linkfluence``` we are looking at ```Saint-denis-sur-loire```.

The same approach can be used for the relationships.

> Linkurious Enterprise will try to use the properties at the top of the list. If a node doesn't have that property, Linkurious Enterprise will look for the next property, etc.
