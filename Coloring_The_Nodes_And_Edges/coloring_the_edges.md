## Coloring the relationships according to a property

We have seen how to color the nodes according to the property of our choice. Coloring the relationships works exactly the same.

By default the relationships are not colored.

If we want to be able to quickly distinguish between the different relationships in our dataset, colors can be helpful.

In order to color the relationships according to a property of our choice, we open the design panel.

By default we can see the properties of the nodes. We elect the ```Relationships``` tab.

Now we can view the different properties associated with the relationships.

We simply have to select the property we want to focus on. Here we want to distinguish the different types of relationships. Thus, we are going to select the ```type``` property.

It is as simple as going over ```type``` and selecting ```Colors```.

Immediately the relationships in our visualization are colored according to their ```type```.

In the design panel, we can see :
* the different values associated with the ```type``` property (HAS_ACQUIRED and HAS_INVESTED_IN);
* how many occurences of each value there is (there are 5 relationships with the value ```HAS_INVESTED_IN```);
* which color is associated to which value (```HAS_INVESTED_IN``` is blue).
