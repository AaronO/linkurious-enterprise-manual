# Starting

First of all, in order to use Linkurious Enterprise you need to [launch Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/download/). Download it, install it and launch it.

Ready? Go in the Linkurious Enterprise folder.

Click on the ```start``` file on Windows. On Linux run ```linkurious.sh start```, on MAC run ```linkurious.sh.command start```. Linkurious Enterprise starts [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) and opens up your browser.

The first time you launch Linkurious Enterprise, it will index the data you are storing on Neo4j. You can follow the progress of the indexation in the Node.js screen. Once it is over, you can use Linkurious Enterprise!
