The options are:
- Fullscreen: to provide a fullscreen view of the graph
- Legend: to display a legend (here "Category" on the left of the screen)
- Search: to display a search bar in order to explore the graph
- Share: to share the visualization
- Zoom: to zoom in and zoom out


On the screenshot below, we have deactivate the legend option and the share option. We can see that the ```Share button``` on the right of the screen disappeared:
