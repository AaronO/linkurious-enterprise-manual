# Icons

In order to obtain a more intuitive visualization, Linkurious Enterprise allows you to change the node appearance with a set of Icons provided by ```Font Awesonme``` (https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)

We click on the upper right corner to open up the design panel and choose the Nodes tab.

We move the mouse to ```categories``` for example and we have acces to both the button to color the nodes or to change their icons.
