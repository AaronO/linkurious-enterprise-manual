# Style

In this chapter, we'll learn how to adjust the size, color, captions and text of nodes or relationships.

These techniques will help you make your visualizations more meaningful.

The styles set in new visualizations are automatically re-applied to newly created visualizations.

However, a default style may be defined by the Administrator of Linkurious Enterprise.
