## Organize visualizations

Visualizations are by default added in the Dashboard. From the dashboard we can delete, rename or open a visualization.

We can also organize the visualizations in folders.

### Open, rename or delete a visualization

The following actions are possible when we right-click on a visualization :
* open : opens the visualization where you left it (with the colors, sizes and filters);
* share: shares the visualization;
* rename : renames the visualization;
* delete : deletes the visualization.

### Arrange visualizations in folders

To create a folder, we click on ```+ Visualization``` in the left menu.
