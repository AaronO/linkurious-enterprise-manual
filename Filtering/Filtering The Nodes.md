# Filtering the Nodes According To A Property

At some point in your graph exploration, you may want to focus on a specific part of your current visualization. A good way to do that is to use filters.

Filters enable you to select or hide multiple nodes or edges at once according to a specific property.

In the graph below, we see the companies [Banexi Ventures](http://www.banexiventures.com/), a small VC firm from France, has invested in.

Where are these companies located in? We could color the nodes according to their ```country``` property to know that. But what if we only want to see the French companies Banexi Venturesis involved with?

To do that, we open the design panel on the right.

We can see the different properties associated with the nodes in our graph.

We are going to click on ```country```.

The different values present in our graph or the property ```country``` appear.
