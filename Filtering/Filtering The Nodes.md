# Filtering the Nodes According To A Property

At some point in your graph exploration, you may want to focus on a specific part of your current visualization. A good way to do that is to use filters.

Filters enable you to select or hide multiple nodes or edges at once according to a specific property.

In the graph below, we see the companies [Banexi Ventures](http://www.banexiventures.com/), a small VC firm from France, has invested in.

Where are these companies located in? We could color the nodes according to their ```country``` property to know that. But what if we only want to see the French companies Banexi Venturesis involved with?

To do that, we open the design panel on the right.

We can see the different properties associated with the nodes in our graph.

We are going to click on ```country```.

The different values present in our graph for the property ```country``` appear. We can see that there are XXX companies from XXX for example.

To select, the companies from France and XXX, simply fill the check boxes.

Now, on the top of the design panel two buttons appear :  ```Filter ``` and  ```Select ```.

To select all the nodes from XXX or XXX, you could click on ```Select ```. Instead we are going to choose ```Filter ```.

Instantly, all the nodes with the values XXX and XXX are removed from the visualization

You can see on the top right corner, a symbol for the filter you added to the visualization is created.

Filtering is a great way to remove unimportant information from a visualization. Use it accordingly!
