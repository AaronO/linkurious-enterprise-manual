# Filtering the Nodes According To A Property

So you have applied one or several filters to your visualization? Maybe it was a mistake or maybe you want to go back a step. How to remove a filter?

An icon for each filter you create is added on the top right corner of the screen. The first filter is on the right and the latest on the left.

In this visualization, there are two filters. The nodes are filtered according to the ```country``` property. The edges are filtered according to the ```funding_round_code``` property

To remove the ```country``` filter, click on the cross next to its icon.
