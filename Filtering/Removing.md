An icon for each filter you create is added on the top right corner of the screen. The first filter is on the right and the latest on the left.

To remove a single filter, click on the cross next to its icon.

The filter is instantly removed. The nodes or edges it hid are then added back to the visualization. If there are other filters in your visualization, they will remain active.
