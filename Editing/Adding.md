The node will be added to your graph.

If we choose to create a relationship, we have to provide the following information :

* ```Type```: the type of relationship;
* ```Source```: the source of the relationship;
* ```Target```: the destination of the relationship.

Like for the nodes, we can add as many properties as we want to the edge. When we are done, we siply click on ```Save```.
