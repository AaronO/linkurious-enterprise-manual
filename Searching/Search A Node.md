# Search A Node

You may have millions of nodes in your graph. What if you are looking at a specific node? You can use the search bar in the Linkurious Enterprise interface to find it quickly (top left corner).

These results are grouped by labels.

For each result, you can view the the node id and its name. You can also see the property that matches your search. In this case, the property ```permalink``` of the Company ```Instagram``` contains the text ```instagra```.
