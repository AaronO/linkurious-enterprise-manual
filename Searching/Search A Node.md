## Search nodes

We may have millions of nodes in our graph. What if we are looking at a specific node? We can use the search bar in the Linkurious Enterprise interface to find it quickly (top left corner).

We simply type what we are looking for. We see the list of suggestions that match our search.

These results are grouped by labels.

For each result, we can view the the node id and its name. We can also see the property that matches our search. In this case, the property ```permalink``` of the Company ```Instagram``` contains the text ```instagra```.

We click on the result of our choice, it will be added to the canvas. Now we can visualize it.

> How it works : by default, Linkurious Enterprise indexes all the properties of your graph. If a node has a property that matches your search, it will be returned.

> For example, you could find the ```Instagram``` node by typing ```instagram```, or ```san francisco``` or ```2010-03-01```.
