# Search A Node

You may have millions of nodes in your graph. What if you are looking at a specific node? You can use the search bar in the Linkurious Enterprise interface to find it quickly (top left corner).

Simply type what you are looking for. You will see a list of suggestions that match your search.

These results are grouped by labels.

For each result, you can view the the node id and its name. You can also see the property that matches your search. In this case, the property "permalink" of the Company "Instagram" contains the text "instagra".

Click on the result of your choice, it will be added to the canvas. Now you can visualize it.

How it works : by default, Linkurious Enterprise indexes all the properties of your graph. If a node has a property that matches your search, it will be returned.

For example, you could find the "Instagram" by typing "instagram", or "san francisco" or "2010-03-01".
