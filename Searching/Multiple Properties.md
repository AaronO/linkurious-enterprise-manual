# Search On Multiple Properties

You are looking for a specific node or edge and the search bar gives you too many results? The text you are searching is too common. You may want to narrow you search by searching on multiple properties.

Only searching a startup that has the text ```facebook```
 on any of his properties gives us too any results.

Click on the "Search nodes" icon in the top left corner.

A new menu appear. In that menu you can see the name of the different labels and properties in your graph.

In our graph, Facebook has the label ```Company```. We are going to select ```Company``` to restrict our search to the nodes that have the label ```Company```.

We can now see the different possible properties associated with the nodes with the ```Company``` label.

In our graph, a ```Company``` can have properties like XXX, XXX or XXX. Not all the nodes with the ```Company``` label will have **all** the properties though.

In order to narrow down our results, we are going to search on multiple properties at once. To find Facebook, we are going to look for a company that uses facebook.com as its home page url and is located in Menlo Park.

Now when we type ``facebook``, the results are filtered to show only the nodes that have the label ```Company```, have the value ```Menlo Park``` for the property ```City``` and the value ``facebook.com`` for the property ```homepage_url```.

You can see that the results are now filtered. Simply click on the result you are interested in.

The same approach can be applied to the search of edges.
