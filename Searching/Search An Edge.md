## Search relationships

We may have millions of relationships in our graph. What if we are looking at a specific relationship? We can use the search bar in the Linkurious Enterprise interface to find it quickly.

By default the search bar searches nodes. To search a relationship, we click on the we hoover over the ```search relationships``` icon.

We click on the icon. Now we can use the search bar to search for relationships. It works exactly like the search for nodes.

We type the text we are looking for. A list of potential matches appear.

In the search result, we can see that there is a relationship that has the value ```1925``` for the property ```amount```.

We choose the result we are interested in by clicking on it. It is immediately added to the canvas where we can visualize it.
