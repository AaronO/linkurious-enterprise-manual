# Search An Edge

You may have millions of edges in your graph. What if you are looking at a specific edge? You can use the search bar in the Linkurious Enterprise interface to find it quickly.

By default the search bar searches nodes. To search an edge, hoover other the "search nodes" icon. A new icon representing a relationship appears.

Click on the icon. Now you can use the search bar to search for relationships. It works exactly like the search for nodes.
