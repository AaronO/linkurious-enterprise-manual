# Expanding And Collapsing

In this chapter, we'll learn how to expand or collapse the relationships of nodes.

Expanding means displaying the nodes that are connected to one node or to a group of node.

Collapsing means removing from the visualization the nodes that are connected to one node or to a group of node.

Learning to expand and collapse nodes is important to navigate in highly connected graph.
