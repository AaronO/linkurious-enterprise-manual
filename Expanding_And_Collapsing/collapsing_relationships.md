# Collapsing Relationships

As you explore your graph, you expand the relationships of one or multiple nodes. Sometimes the nodes and edges added to your visualization may not be relevant. In that case, you can use the collpase functionality to remove them.

Let's say that we are looking at the relationships of Instagram.

We can open up the information panel on the left.

We then select ```Collapse```. The nodes that are connected to Instagram are remove from the visualization.

> You have noticed that two nodes remain after the collapse? They are linked to Instagram **and** linked together. In that case Linkurious Enterprise will keep them in your visualization.
