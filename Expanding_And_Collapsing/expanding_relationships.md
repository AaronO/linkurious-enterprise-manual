# Expanding Relationships

By clicking on a node, it is possible to view all of his relationships.

Alternatively, you can select a node and use ```Expand``` on the left panel to accomplish the same thing.

It is possible to expand the relationships of multiple nodes or edges at the same time.

> It is tempting to always add more nodes and edges to your visualization. Beware though, if you are not careful you may end up with too many nodes on your screen...and a worthless visualization.

> In order to avoid that, remember to always think twice before adding more information to your visualization. The filters and the hide functionality are here to help!
