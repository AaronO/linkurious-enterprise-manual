# Expand Nodes

Expand nodes to display their relationships and direct neighbors. We can expand nodes in different ways:

* double-click on a node in the view
* select one or multiple nodes, then click on the ```Expand``` button of the left panel.
* right-click on a node in the view, then click on the ```Expand``` button of the tooltip.

The ```Expand``` buttons display the list of available relationship types and neighbor categories. We can choose to get everything or to filter the retrieved relationships and neighbors.



> It is tempting to always add more nodes and edges to your visualization. Beware though, if you are not careful you may end up with too many nodes on your screen... and a worthless visualization.

> In order to avoid that, remember to always think twice before adding more information to your visualization. The filters and the hide functionality are here to help!
