Linkurious is the sum of two components: the frontend, running in the web browser and providing the user interface, and the backend, server component connected to the graph database. The backend provides a fast search engine and runs on any system able to support node.js, including Windows, Linux and Mac OS.

While we ship a lightweight search engine fully running in memory, it can easily be switched to another engine such as Apache Lucene. The graph database can be located on the same machine as the backend or on any other machine in your network.

Below is a list of the open source technologies we use. They have proven to be efficient and reliable:

* [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/)
* [Sigma.js](http://sigmajs.org/)
* [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
