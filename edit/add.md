* ```Type```: the type of relationship;
* ```Source```: the source of the relationship;
* ```Target```: the destination of the relationship.

Like for the nodes, we can add as many properties as we want to the edge. When we are done, we simply click on ```Save```.

Here we entered the value ```Twitter - USA #7707``` for the Source, the value ```INVESTED_IN``` for the Type property and the value ```NewInvestor #14865``` for the Target and finally ```2015``` for the funded_year property.


Finally, we can see in our graph our new node and our new edge:
