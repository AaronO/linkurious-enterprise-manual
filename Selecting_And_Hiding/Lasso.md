# Using The Lasso

It is possible to select the nodes or edges within a particular area of your visualization. In order to do that Linkurious Enterprise provides a lasso.

To do it, choose ```Select``` in the information panel on the left.

Move the lasso around the nodes you are interested in selecting to select them.
