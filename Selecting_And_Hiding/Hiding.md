# Hiding Nodes And Edges

Your visualization is getting too complex and you may want to remove a few nodes or edges to make it easier to understand.

Simply select the node(s) or edge(s) you want to remove with one of the tool described in this chapter.

For example, in the picture above I have selected two nodes. I simply have to click on ```Hide``` to remove them from the visualization.
