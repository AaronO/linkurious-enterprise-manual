# Selecting Nodes

The easiest way to select a node or an edge is to simply click on it. It is also possible to select multiple nodes at once.

To do it, choose ```Select``` in the information panel on the left.

You now have a few options :

* ```Select all nodes``` : select all the nodes in your current visualization ;
* ```Select neighbours``` : select the neighboors of your currently select node ;
* ```Select leaf nodes``` : select the nodes in your visualization that have only one relationship ;
* ```Select isolates``` : select the nodes in your visualization that have no relationships ;
* ```Select all relationships``` : select all the edges in your current visualization ;
* ```Inverse selection``` : invert your current selection.
