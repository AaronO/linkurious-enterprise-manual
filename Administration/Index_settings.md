## Search index

Choose which data properties will be available in search results by configuring the index. By default, Linkurious indexes all disclosed data properties. Notice that undisclosed properties are not indexed and thus cannot be found via the search engine.

### Change the list of indexed properties

Go to the data management dashboard. Unindexed properties are listed on the left side of the screen. Indexed properties are listed on the right side of the screen. Move properties from one list to the other to change their status.

For instance, we do not want to index the `category` property of nodes. Select the `category` property, and click on the left arrow to move it to the list of unindexed properties. Click on the **Apply** button.

Do the same for relationship properties.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  Reindex data to remove the `category` property from search results.
</div>
