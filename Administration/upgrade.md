### Manual upgrades

Before Linkurious v0.10, no update procedure is available. To upgrade Linkurious, you need to install a new version and delete the previous one. All visualizations, users, groups and access-rights will be lost.

In some cases, copying the `database.db` file from the old Linkurious to new Linkurious folder can work, but it is not guaranteed and depends on versions.
