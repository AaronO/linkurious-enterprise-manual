# User groups

As an administrator, you can create groups and assign users to them. This makes applying security and customization settings to users easier.

To manage your user groups, select ```Users``` in the administrator dashboard.

By default, you have two user groups :

*  ```Admin ``` : The admin group has read-write access to everything

*  ```Default ``` : The default group has read-only access to everything

New users will automatically assigned to the ```Default``` group.
