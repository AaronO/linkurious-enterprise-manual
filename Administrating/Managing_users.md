# Manage existing users

From the ```Users``` screen, we can manage any user by clicking on ```Edit``` or ```Delete``` next to the user of our choice.

# User groups

User groups provide permissions to read or write on nodes and relationships in the graph database. Each permission is defined at the level of node categories and edge types. Groups are defined for each data source.

Administrators can create groups and assign them to users.

Click on ```Users``` in the administrator dashboard to manage user groups.

Two user groups are available by default:

*  ```Admin ``` : The admin group has read and write access to graph data.

*  ```Default ``` : The default group has read-only access to graph data.

The ```Default``` group is assigned to new users by default.
