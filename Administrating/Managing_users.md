# Manage existing users

From the ```Users``` screen, it is possible to edit (groups, name, email or password) or delete any user.

Simply select the ```Edit``` or ```Delete``` icon next to the user of your choice.

# User groups

To manage your user groups, select ```Users``` in the administrator dashboard.
