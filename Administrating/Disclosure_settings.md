# Data Disclosure

We may prevent specific nodes or relationship properties to be accessed by Linkurious Enterprise. Undisclosed data properties cannot be reached by Linkurious users nor be indexed by the search engine.

Click on ```Data``` in the Administration dashboard.

By default, Linkurious Enterprise displays all the properties of the nodes and edges.

# Changing the displayed properties

There is a list of the properties that are disclosed and a list of the properties that are undisclosed. Simply move the properties from one list to the other to change their status.

I want to avoid my users seeing the ```category``` property.

Use the checkbox to select the ```category``` property. Cick on the left arrow.

![the category property is disclosed](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/680zesrr7owomi9/107.png?dl=0)

Hit ```Apply```. The ```category``` property will not show up in the interface of the users.

With the same interface, you can choose which properties of the edges you want to disclose or not.
