# Data Disclosure

We may prevent specific nodes or relationship properties to be accessed by Linkurious Enterprise. Undisclosed data properties cannot be reached by Linkurious users nor be indexed by the search engine.

Go to the ```Data``` panel of the Administration dashboard.

By default, Linkurious Enterprise discloses all the properties of nodes and edges.

## Change the list of disclosed properties

The list of undisclosed is on the left side of the screen. The list of disclosed properties is on the right side of the screen. Move properties from one list to the other to change their status.

For instance, we want to avoid users to access the ```category``` property of nodes.

![the category property is disclosed](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/piuu9duoefvc4f0/106.png?dl=0)

Select the ```category``` property. Click on the left arrow to move it to the list of undisclosed properties.

![the category property is disclosed](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/680zesrr7owomi9/107.png?dl=0)

Click on ```Apply```. The ```category``` property will not show up in visualizations. You must reindex data to remove it from search results.

The same process applies for relationship properties.
