# Data Disclosure

We may prevent specific nodes or relationship properties to be accessed by Linkurious Enterprise. Undisclosed data properties cannot be reached by Linkurious users nor be indexed by the search engine.

Go to the ```Data``` panel of the Administration dashboard.

By default, Linkurious Enterprise discloses all the properties of nodes and edges.

## Edit the list of disclosed properties

There is a list of the properties that are disclosed and a list of the properties that are undisclosed. Simply move the properties from one list to the other to change their status.

I want to avoid my users seeing the ```category``` property.

Use the checkbox to select the ```category``` property. Cick on the left arrow.

![the category property is disclosed](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/680zesrr7owomi9/107.png?dl=0)

Hit ```Apply```. The ```category``` property will not show up in the interface of the users.

With the same interface, you can choose which properties of the edges you want to disclose or not.
