# Disclosure settings

It is possible to choose which properties of your data will appear to the users in the interface.

To do that, select ```Data``` in the administrator dashboard.

By default, Linkurious Enterprise displays all the properties of the nodes and edges.

# Changing the displayed properties

There is a list of the properties that are disclosed and a list of the properties that are undisclosed. Simply move the properties from one list to the other to change their status.

I want to avoid my users seeing the ```category``` property.

Use the checkbox to select the ```category``` property. Cick on the left arrow.

Hit ```Apply```. The ```category``` property will not show up in the interface of the users.

With the same interface, you can choose which properties of the edges you want to disclose or not.
