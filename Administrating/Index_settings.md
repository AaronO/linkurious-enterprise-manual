# Search Index

Choose which data properties will be available in search results by configuring the index. By default, Linkurious Enterprise indexes all disclosed data properties.

Go to the ```Data``` panel of the Administration dashboard.

Notice that undisclosed properties are not indexed and thus cannot be found via the search engine.

## Change the list of indexed properties

The list of unindexed is on the left side of the screen. The list of indexed properties is on the right side of the screen. Move properties from one list to the other to change their status.

We do not want to index the ```category``` property of nodes.

With the same interface, you can choose which properties of the edges you want to index or not.
