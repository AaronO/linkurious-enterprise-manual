# Search Index

Choose which data properties will be available in search results by configuring the index. By default, Linkurious Enterprise indexes all disclosed data properties.

Go to the ```Data``` panel of the Administration dashboard.

Notice that undisclosed properties are not indexed and thus cannot be found via the search engine.

## Change the list of indexed properties

There is a list of the properties that are indexed and a list of the properties that are not indexed. Simply move the properties from one list to the other to change their status.

I do not want to index the ```category``` property.

Use the checkbox to select the ```category``` property. Cick on the left arrow.

Hit ```Apply```. The ```category``` property will not show up in the interface of the users.

With the same interface, you can choose which properties of the edges you want to index or not.
