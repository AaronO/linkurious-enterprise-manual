# Index Settings

It is possible to choose which properties of your data will be indexed. Dropping properties from your index will make the indexing and the search faster.

To do that, select ```Data``` in the administrator dashboard.

By default Linkurious Enterprise index all your properties. That means that all of these properties can be found via the search engine.

Note that undisclosed properties are not indexed and thus cannot be found via the search engine.

# Changing the indexed properties

There is a list of the properties that are indexed and a list of the properties that are not indexed. Simply move the properties from one list to the other to change their status.

I do not want to index the ```category``` property.

Use the checkbox to select the ```category``` property. Cick on the left arrow.

Hit ```Apply```. The ```category``` property will not show up in the interface of the users.

With the same interface, you can choose which properties of the edges you want to index or not.
